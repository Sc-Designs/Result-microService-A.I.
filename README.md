## 🖼️ System Design

![AI Interviewer Architecture](./diagram-export-9-4-2025-8_30_05-PM.png)

The system is designed using **microservices**, connected via a **Gateway** and **Socket.IO** for real-time communication.  
- **Web Speech API** handles Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech for voice-based interviews.  
- **AI Microservice** integrates **Groq** and **Gemini AI** for intelligent question answering and evaluation.  
- **Result Microservice** handles scoring and reporting.  
- **Organization, User, and Admin Microservices** manage role-specific operations.  
- **Question & Test Microservices** handle question banks and test management.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
**Frontend**
- React.js + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion  
- Socket.IO Client  
- Axios (for API calls)  
- Web Speech API (for speech recognition & synthesis)  

**Backend (Microservices)**
- Node.js + Express  
- MongoDB (separate DB per service)  
- Socket.IO (real-time communication)  

**AI Layer**
- **Groq** → Fast inference & model execution  
- **Gemini AI** → Conversational understanding & evaluation  
- Web Speech API → Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech  

## **Deployment**
- Render (each microservice hosted separately)

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sc-Designs/Result-microService-A.I.
```

###  Setup .env for each microservice



# inside each service
npm install

### Run locally
npm run dev

## 🚀 Usage Flow

 - Organization creates a test set.

 - Candidate joins the interview (text or voice).

 - AI Microservice (Groq + Gemini) generates/responds to questions.

 - Web Speech API converts voice ↔ text.

 - Result Microservice evaluates and stores the score.

 - Admin monitors and manages platform-wide activity.


### 📊 Example Workflow

- Candidate logs in → Gateway routes to User Microservice

- Organization assigns a test → Gateway routes to Test & Question Microservices

- Candidate answers via voice → Web Speech API → AI Microservice (Groq + Gemini) → evaluates

- Result Microservice generates score & report

- Data stored in dedicated service databases
